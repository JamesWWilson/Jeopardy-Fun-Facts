7PM PST on a weeknight means watching Jeopardy, no matter the situation. I'll watch the show with anyone that's willing to listen as I yell answers at a television screen where Alex Trebek asks random trivia questions. Jeopardy has been a central feature for me throughout my life, bonding with my Dad or college roommates while competing to see who is the “smartest”. 

The show is known for its structured and professional manner, where contestants are cordial with one another and all demonstrate a sort of deference to the show and its legendary host. After the first commercial break, however, all contestants are given a chance to discuss something interesting about themselves. This is where, in my opinion, anyone watching gets to enjoy the feeling that you get from watching the Bachelor at 8PM: judgement. It is incredibly fun watching contestants talk about incredible feats of achievement they have had, or embarase themselves with a story about _____.

In celebration of the Ultimate Champions tournament taking place this week, I thought it would be fun to look at anyone but the Champions. More specifically, I want to take a deep dive into the types of people that make it onto the show, and what aspect of their lives they think is worth discussing in front of a live audience. And more importantly, from a data perspective, can we simulate and create our own Jeopardy "fun fact" generator? 

## Part 1: The Data

We can collect information on Jeopardy contestants from two sources: the Offical Jeopardy Archive & @CoolJeopardyStories on Twitter. 
The Jeopardy Archive collects and maintains all details related to the show, including: ________

___ scraper function ___
```{python}

```
__output__

For the "fun fact" part of the analysis, we rely on the work of ______ , who ran the @CoolJeopardyStories account from ___ to ____. 
Without episode transcripts easily available online[], we have to rely on the transcription work done by ___. While these transcription aren't perfect representations, they get to the meat of the stories and should work for our purpouses. 

____ tweepy function ___
```{python}

```
__output__

We can merge these two datasets together on their respective player id and show date to create a full data frame of contestants and their respective details. 


## Part 2: Player Statistics


Where contestant come from & what their occupations are
Any correlation to winnings? 
Deal with outliers / control for candidate who has won multiple times
 






## Part 3: Sentiment Analysis and a Fun Fact Text-Bot Using TextGenRNN
	The main challenge is to create several of our own faux jeopardy contestants with different features and see who they are 
	Winner 
	Average
	Big loser 

LSTM Model ? 



## Part 4:  Conclusion
